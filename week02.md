  * Each member of the team should be working on the same design
  * As a group have a discussion about the following:
    * How are you going to break up the HTML - what does your grid look like, what types of elements are you going to use
    * What type of CSS do you need?
  * Once your team has discussed the above each person should create their own github repo and begin coding
  * Remember to break the page into simple features and make the appropriate branches and PRs.
  * Your final code is not expected to look like the rest of your team.  You should be working with them to plan but then code on your own (ask your team for help as needed).
