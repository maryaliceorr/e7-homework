# Week 2 Homework: HTML/CSS/Git

## Studygroup Assignment(s)
1. As a team pick a [CSS Zen Garden Design](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/) 
  * Each member of the team should be working on the same design
  * As a group have a discussion about the following:
    * How are you going to break up the HTML - what does your grid look like, what types of elements are you going to use
    * What type of CSS do you need and how should it be organized?
  * Once your team has discussed the above, each person should create their own github repo and begin coding
  * Remember to break the page into simple features and make the appropriate branches and PRs.
  * Your final code is not expected to look like the rest of your team.  You should be working with them to plan but then code on your own (ask your team for help as needed).
  

## Individual Assignment(s)
  1. Make 25 github repos - 5 wednesday, 5 thursday, 5 friday, 5 saturday, 5 sunday (DO NOT DO ALL 25 ON THE SAME DAY)
    * Each repo should be name Test# - the # should start with 5 and end with 30 (test5, test6, test7...test30)
    * Each repo should start with a README.md file that you push to master branch
    * Each repo should have a setup branch.  This branch should have an index.html and main.css file.  The index.html file should have html boilerplate and a link to the CSS file.  The css file should change the background color.
    * There should be PR from the setup branch to the master branch
    * Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing)
    * Final result for a repo should have everything merged into master

 2. [Blog post #1](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/homework/blob/master/blog.md):  This should be a NICE LONG blog post covering everything you learned/found interesting about HTML, CSS, GIT,  and github.  For this blog post please put it in the index.html of your personal site.  At this point you do not need to spend time formatting it - you will do that next week.
